# Git Practice Repository

You can view a website using a little bit of html/javascript/css here to test out using gh pages: https://sebastian-saverino.github.io/gitdemo/

This repository is a simple collection of files used to practice and demonstrate
core Git workflows, including:

- Creating and committing changes
- Working with multiple branches
- Merging branches
- Restoring files and commits

The goal of this repo is learning and experimentation rather than production code.
