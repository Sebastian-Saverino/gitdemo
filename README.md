# Git Practice Repository

This repository is a simple collection of files used to practice and demonstrate
core Git workflows, including:

- Creating and committing changes
- Working with multiple branches
- Merging branches
- Restoring files and commits

The goal of this repo is learning and experimentation rather than production code.
